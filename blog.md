### September
I'll be presenting my paper "Local News Hijacking: A Review of International Instances" at the IDeaS conference September 18-20 at Carnegie Mellon University. I'll also be in attendance of the SBP-BRiMS 2024 conference presenting a poster titled "Comparing Social-cyber Maneuvers Across Platforms and News Types During the 2022 U.S. Midterm Election." 

I will also be presenting my research on threats to local news at a panel on a Disinformation Day pannel on September 26 at Carnegie Mellon University. 

### April
My paper, "What News Is Shared Where and How: A Multi-Platform Analysis of News Shared During the 2022 U.S. Midterm Elections" was published in Social Media + Society! You can read the paper [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051241245950), or you can read the blog post I created for it [on the IDeaS website](https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/news1/blog-posts/blog-lepird-news-types.html).

### February
I successfully proposed my thesis! To read more about it, you can read the document <a href="/lepird_proposal.pdf" target="_blank">here </a>.

### October
I attended the [Post-API Conference](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/postapiconference/home) in Philadelphia. I enjoyed the trip to my hometown and getting to hear from other researchers about how they're handling the changing social media data landscape. 

### September

I presented at the [SBP-Brims](https://sbp-brims.org/2023/) and [IDeaS](https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/events/conference-index.html) Conferences in Pittsburgh September 20-22.
