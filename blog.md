I've created a blog to highlight some of my recent research. Feel free to follow along or email [me](mailto:csowa@andrew.cmu.edu) your thoughts.

# 2023

### November
I'll be attending the [Tech Ethics Symposium](https://www.duq.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/grefenstette-center/grefenstette-symposium.php) in Pittsburgh November 9-10 and presenting my poster on automated local news. Let me know if you'll be attending!

### October
I attended the [Post-API Conference](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/postapiconference/home) in Philadelphia. I enjoyed the trip to my hometown and getting to hear from other researchers about how they're handling the changing social media data landscape. 

### September

I presented at the [SBP-Brims](https://sbp-brims.org/2023/) and [IDeaS](https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/events/conference-index.html) Conferences in Pittsburgh September 20-22.

Back in 2020, my department at CMU interviewed me about my research and what information I would share with potential applicants to the PhD program. You can find the video here:
