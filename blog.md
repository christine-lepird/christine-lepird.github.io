I've created a blog to highlight some of my recent research. Feel free to follow along or email [me](mailto:csowa@andrew.cmu.edu) your thoughts.

# 2024

### November
November was a busy month for me! On the 7th, I successfully defended my PhD thesis. I have some minor revisions to make, but you can see the current version <a href="/Lepird_Thesis_Oct2024.pdf" target="_blank">here </a>. 

Two weeks later, I gave birth to my second baby! I'm spending the rest of 2024 on maternity leave but will be back in the office in 2025. Some things I'm excited to do: publish my international instances of local news hijacking paper, finish a paper with a colleague on URL backlinks to pink slime sites discussing news diversity, and publish a paper analyzing all of the ads pink slime sites have purchased on Meta platforms since 2018. 

### October
My paper, "Non-credibility scores: Relative ranking of news sites shared on social media to identify new pink slime sites" was published in First Monday! You can read the paper [here](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/13544)!

### September
I'll be presenting my paper "Local News Hijacking: A Review of International Instances" at the IDeaS conference September 18-20 at Carnegie Mellon University. I'll also be in attendance of the SBP-BRiMS 2024 conference presenting a poster titled "Comparing Social-cyber Maneuvers Across Platforms and News Types During the 2022 U.S. Midterm Election." 

I will also be presenting my research on threats to local news at a panel on a Disinformation Day pannel on September 26 at Carnegie Mellon University. 

### April
My paper, "What News Is Shared Where and How: A Multi-Platform Analysis of News Shared During the 2022 U.S. Midterm Elections" was published in Social Media + Society! You can read the paper [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051241245950), or you can read the blog post I created for it [on the IDeaS website](https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/news1/blog-posts/blog-lepird-news-types.html). I'm particularly proud of this paper for a few reasons, but mostly I think it is important in defining the "Big 4 News Types" - low credibility news, real news, pink slime, and local news - on a grid of scope and credibility.

### February
I successfully proposed my thesis! To read more about it, you can read the document <a href="/lepird_proposal.pdf" target="_blank">here </a>. I plan to defend the thesis in November of this year.

### November
I created the following images along with Matt Hicks and the support of the IDeaS Center at CMU to help spread guidance on spotting disinformation and auto-generated content.

I attended the [Tech Ethics Symposium](https://www.duq.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/grefenstette-center/grefenstette-symposium.php) in Pittsburgh November 9-10 and presented my poster on automated local news (below). I ended up winning best graduate student poster!

### October
I attended the [Post-API Conference](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/postapiconference/home) in Philadelphia. I enjoyed the trip to my hometown and getting to hear from other researchers about how they're handling the changing social media data landscape. 

### September

I presented at the [SBP-Brims](https://sbp-brims.org/2023/) and [IDeaS](https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/events/conference-index.html) Conferences in Pittsburgh September 20-22. 

# 2020

Back in 2020, my department at CMU interviewed me about my research and what information I would share with potential applicants to the PhD program. You can find the video here:
