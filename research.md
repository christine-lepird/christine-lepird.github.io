### Social Network Analysis

My primary area of research is in social network analysis - a field of study that investigates social structures through ties of various strengths. While the field has been around for decades, I am excited to apply the principles to newer platforms, like Reddit and Facebook, to differentiate between organic communities and malicious networks that post misinformation. One of my main topics of study is pink slime, a type of inauthentic local news that has been spreading across the United States online news ecosystem. 

As you might notice from my Github, I program in Python, but I particularly enjoy doing data analysis and app development (Shiny) in R. Most of my cursory data exploration is in hasty SQL queries which I typically forget to clean and comment before committing (sorry).

In 2020 I legally changed my name from Christine Marie Sowa to Christine Sowa Lepird - if you come across publications under either name that you like, it's likely written by me (if you don't like the paper, I'm willing to pretend I don't know the other Christine who authored it).

### Teaching and Mentoring
* During the Spring 2023 semester, I TA'd [Dynamic Network Analysis](https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/courses/19-640.html) under Prof. Kathleen M. Carley at CMU.
* In the Summer of 2023, I supervised an intern who I collaborated with to analyze social media news sharing during the 2022 U.S. Midterms. I've enjoyed mentoring two more interns when I was a researcher at JHU APL. 

### School Projects
* I made [this website](https://csowa-ids-final.weebly.com/) to analyze what the Russian Internet Research Agency was doing on Reddit around the time of the 2016 election for my Interactive Data Science class in the Fall of 2019.
