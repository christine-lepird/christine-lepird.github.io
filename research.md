### Social Network Analysis

My primary area of research is in social network analysis - a field of study that investigates social structures through ties of various strengths. While the field has been around for decades, I am excited to apply the principles to newer platforms, like Reddit and Twitter, to differentiate between organic communities and malicious networks that post fake news. As you might notice from my Github, I program in Python, but I particularly enjoy doing data analysis and app development (Shiny) in R. Most of my cursory data exploration is in hasty SQL queries which I typically forget to clean and comment before committing (sorry).
