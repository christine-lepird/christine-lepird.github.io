In addition to my research interests, I enjoy swimming, biking and reading. I have an amazing husband, [Jack](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jlepird/), who works for Argo AI building the artificial intelligence behind self-driving cars. Together, we have two tabby cats, a puppy, and a 100-year-old house where we spend our weekends doing countless projects.

### STEM Demos

I do weekly STEM demos to the children of the [Boys and Girls Club](https://www.bgca.org/) in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh. I cover electronics, chemistry, physics, engineering, and robotics. I'm always looking for new ideas for demos, so please reach out if you have suggestions!

### Webmaster

When St. Mary of the Mount and Prince of Peace Parish of Southside merged, I was asked to make a joint website for them. I now update [the site](http://popsmm.org) with information as the two continue to merge.

### Alumni Involvement

I am the alumni class president for MIT's class of 2014. Previously, I was the alumni class secreatary for [MIT's class of 2014](http://2014.alumclass.mit.edu/) from 2014-2019. I reported on what the alumni from my class are up to in the [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/)'s Class Notes section. Additionally, I interview prospective undergraduate students in the Pittsburgh area as part of the application process.
