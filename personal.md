In addition to my research interests, I enjoy swimming, biking and reading.

### STEM Demos

I do weekly STEM demos to the children of the [Boys and Girls Club](https://www.bgca.org/) in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh. I cover electronics, chemistry, physics, engineering, and robotics. I'm always looking for new ideas for demos, so please reach out if you have suggestions!

### Webmaster

When St. Mary of the Mount and Prince of Peace Parish of Southside merged, I was asked to make a joint website for them. I now update [the site](http://popsmm.org) with information as the two continue to merge.

### Cat Fostering

In addition to my two tabby cats, I've been fostering two elderly cats.
